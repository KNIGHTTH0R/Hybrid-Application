# SuTalk

My goal is to win Facebook among Korean University students.
For the most part of Univ's students use Facebook as a community space of them.
The spaces are called as "Dae-na-mu-soop" or "dae-sin-jun-hae-de-rip-ni-da", thay mean pages that uploads students' messages instead.

However, there are some critical inconveniences, and I'm gonna solve the problems perfectly.

# We are
- 4 Bulletin boards to write freely
- telephone book including inside & outside information of University
- Combination of University Websites (Also, I Changed Desktop version Websites to Mobile view)
- Time tables (Public transportation, School bus)
- Medium and small firm recruting service(preparing)
- Information about recruting and Start up one's business
