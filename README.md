# SuTalk

My goal is to win Facebook among Korean University students.
For the most part of Univ's students use Facebook as a community space of them.
The spaces are called as "Dae-na-mu-soop" or "dae-sin-jun-hae-de-rip-ni-da", thay mean pages that uploads students' messages instead.

However, there are some critical inconveniences.
